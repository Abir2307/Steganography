# Steganography
This project implements image-based steganography using Python and OpenCV, allowing users to securely hide messages inside an image without noticeable distortion. The hidden message can only be retrieved with the correct passcode, adding an extra layer of security.
Made using Least Significant Bit (LSB) manipulation.
